# First draft on effective code communication

In a software engineers career, you will be ask to write and read code. You write code when you want the computer to do something for you and you read code when you are trying to understand what a code block is doing and how it relates to other parts of the codebase and its significance to the whole.

And since if it is something you do over and over, there must be a way for us coders to make ourselves efficient in both reading and writing code. Apart from that, we should be able to communicate what the code in front of us is doing, neither if we wrote it or somebody else wrote it. We should be able to say this code is ________. A better  is we should be able to compose it as this code is _verb_ a _noun_. We should be able to describe tge code simply either from the name or what the code implies at quick glance. Looking at code, there are actually 3 main thing a code does, it may be to (1) create something, (2) it organises something, and (3) it manipulates something. So let's say, you want to write to a database. first usually you create the data that the db will accept, then you you write the method to write to the database, and you try to structure the code so that its easy to comprehend.

That means that when looking at a code, you must quickly can decipher if the code is trying to create something, organises something, or manipulates something. Most often you will find that a code block would try to do 3 things and that's actually a good way to think about improving the code but that is another topic that we will not try to cover here because this is just a conceptual framework on code communication and can be treated as an introduction to the implementation details. 

What we are after here is how we can improve our grammar to effectively communicate code in front of us. In this way, we would easily be able to navigate the code base and point what something is doing and create a mental picture of the bits and pieces of the code. This way its easier for us to read complex code effectively. The purpose of this study is not to introduce new terminologies but to teach us how to use these terms effectively so that we can use our time effectively. We may have to look back to our fundamentals so that we use the proper terminilogies when explaining code. We may have to use some terminologies in our design patterns and how we can use them in communicating code.
