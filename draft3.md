### Some realizations
I tried practicing the method I wrote in an earlier draft and it seems to help in developing a mental framework of the code base. It allows you to decipher quickly how code blocks relate to one another and things are organise without giving too much in the implementation details. That's somehow the limit of this study, because it does give you how things work(implementation details) but instead it gives you the relationships of the code blocks with each other. One practical use of this study is it allows you quickly draw a mental scaffold of the code base and see the _main_ thing and how it is positioned in the code base. 

The repositories I used to practice the method are the following
- ReactJs
- ReactPlayer
- Mem
